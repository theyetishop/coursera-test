<h1>Hello Coursera! I learned how to use Github!</h1>
</body>
<p>Finished the first section. I learned how to setup a GitHub account and create a repository to fluidly clone local files to the respository in Github to be hosted. I also learned how to setup the browser sync so that my code updates get seamlessly updated in local host.
